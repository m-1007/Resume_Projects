## Under the Hood

*(Code is private — let's chat about it in an interview!)*

- **Framework**: Built with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) for backend development
- **Dependency Management**: Managed with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- **Database**: Integrated with **MySQL** (or any DB you used) to store movie data, showtimes, bookings, and user profiles
- **REST APIs**: Exposed RESTful APIs for retrieving movie data, booking tickets, and managing schedules
- **Frontend**: For UI, used basic HTML/CSS
- **Testing**: Unit tests using **JUnit** and **Mockito** for backend testing

---

## Team Collaboration

- **Git Workflow**: We used **Git** for version control, following a **GitFlow** branching model for feature development, bug fixes, and releases
- **Task Management**: Tasks were managed via **Todoist** and regularly updated in **weekly sprint cycles**
- **Code Review**: Code reviews were held after each feature implementation to ensure quality and consistency

---

## Results

- Fully functional backend with **CRUD operations** for movies, showtimes, and bookings.
- Implemented an efficient booking system where users can select seats for a specific showtime.
- **User Feedback**: Multiple users were able to successfully book tickets without errors.

## Why I Built This

This project was built to demonstrate how a full-stack web application can be developed and deployed using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and a **relational database**. The goal was to create a scalable and efficient movie theater booking system that could be expanded upon for future enhancements, such as adding payment integration, notifications, or additional user features.

## Tech Highlights

- **Spring Boot** for creating a robust backend with minimal setup
- **Maven** for dependency management and project building
- **MySQL** for storing and managing data, with relationships between movies, showtimes, and bookings
- **REST APIs** for interacting with the frontend or external services
- **Unit Testing**: Used **JUnit** and **Mockito** for backend testing to ensure stable code
