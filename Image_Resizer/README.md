## Behind the Scenes

*(Code is private — reach out if you want to dive deeper!)*

- **Framework**: Built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) for cross-platform desktop support
- **UI**: Vanilla HTML/CSS with minimal dependencies — lightweight and fast
- **Image Processing**: Done locally using the HTML5 Canvas API
- **Notifications**: User feedback handled via [Toastify.js](https://apvarun.github.io/toastify-js/) for smooth success/error messaging
- **File Handling**: Uses Node.js `fs` module to read/write images to disk
- **UX**: Async image processing, persistent output folder, and user-friendly alerts

## Why I Built This

I needed a lightweight, browser-based tool for quick image resizing — no logins, no server upload, just fast local processing for devs, designers, or anyone working with images.

## Tech Highlights

- Fully client-side — zero backend needed
