## Under the Hood

*(Code is private — let’s talk about it in an interview!)*

- **Libraries Used**:
    - **Data wrangling**: Pandas, NumPy
    - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
    - **Modeling**: scikit-learn
    - **Metrics**: scikit-learn metrics for classification evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)
- **Dataset**: Public dataset of credit card transactions (or mention any synthetic dataset used) (from kaggle)
- **Preprocessing**: 
    - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features
    - Addressed class imbalance using oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling techniques
- **Modeling**: 
    - Evaluated multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
    - Performed hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
- **Performance Evaluation**: 
    - Split the dataset into training/testing sets and performed k-fold cross-validation
    - Used performance metrics (ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix) to assess model quality

## Results

- The best-performing model was **Random Forest**, achieving an precision of **83%** and a recall of **87%**, making it highly suitable for detecting fraudulent transactions.
- **Class imbalance** was addressed effectively, achieving good results even with a skewed dataset.

## Why I Built This

Fraud detection in financial transactions is a critical problem for banks and credit card companies. By building this model, I wanted to showcase how ML can be used to detect fraudulent behavior and improve security in digital payments.

## Tech Highlights

- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Implemented **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic instances of the minority class (fraudulent transactions).
- **Model Comparison**: Compared multiple machine learning models, demonstrating the trade-offs between accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Model Tuning**: Fine-tuned model hyperparameters for better performance and faster convergence.
